# En-Am Translator : Selam -> ሰላም

This project is just Translator Amharic written in English to real Amharic characters. like

Selam <-> ሰላም

It doesn't use any AI model or module like tensorflow or something, just with simple class it is been translated instantly. But it can be more powerful if AI is implmented on it indeed.

If you know how, and want to contribute, just do that, who knows this might be the project you was looking for to learn & practice a lot more.
